      <h1> Our Mission! </h1> 
      
      <p> Many public spaces do not provide a safe or empowering environment for women. </p>
      <p> It is a universal experience for women to feel unsafe in their daily lives and this negatively affects the wellbeing of women. </p> 
      <p> More resources and support systems and communities need to be set up and made accessible for women to feel more safe and empowered in their everyday lives. Through <em>Empowher</em>, we hope to create a safe, supportive, and empowering space that all women can come to for resources regarding their safety and mental health.</p>
