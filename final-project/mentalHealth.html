      <p>----------Whether it’s taking a walk, following a Youtube workout, or hitting the gym, it’s important that we move our bodies regularly!</p> 
      <p>----------Aerobic exercise helps decrease depression and anxiety and improve moods. When you exercise, your body makes chemicals called endorphins, which can help relieve stress and boost feelings of calm and happiness.</p>
      <p>-----Eat balanced, nutritious meals.</p>
      <p>-----Drink lots of water.</p> 
      <p>-----Get enough sleep.</p>
      <p>-----Avoid smoking and vaping.</p>
      <p>2. Surround yourself and connect with people you love.</p>
      <p>-----Spend time (calling, hanging out, grabbing a meal, etc.) with your family, your friends, or anyone who makes you smile :).</p>
      <p>3. Make time for your hobbies and interests outside of work or school.</p>
      <p>4. Practice gratitude. Look for something positive in each day.</p>
      <p>5. Find ways to relax that work for you. A few examples are meditating, journaling, doing yoga, listening to music, and taking a walk.</p>
      <p>6. Seek professional help when you need it.</p>
